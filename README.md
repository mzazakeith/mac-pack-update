# Automated macOS Package Update Script

This script automates the process of updating and upgrading software packages on macOS using cron jobs and the Homebrew package manager. It ensures that your system stays up-to-date with the latest software releases, enhancing security, stability, and performance.

## Features:

- Updates Homebrew package list and upgrades all installed packages.
- Cleans up old package versions to free up disk space.
- Checks for any issues with Homebrew installation.
- Updates npm to the latest version and global npm packages.
- Customizable for additional updates or commands.

## Usage:

1. Ensure Homebrew is installed on your macOS system. If not, you can install it from the official website: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

2. Create a script file named `update_script.sh` and paste the provided script into it.

3. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x update_script.sh`.

4. Schedule the script to run automatically using crontabs. Open the cron configuration file by running `crontab -e` and add the following lines:

```
0 2 */2 * * brew update
0 3 * * 0 /path/to/update_script.sh
```

Replace `/path/to/update_script.sh` with the actual path to your script file.

5. Enjoy automated package updates and improved system maintenance!
